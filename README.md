#  Bin packing with dual resources

Implementation of the first fit decreasing bin packing algorithm for dual resources.

Each bin has a capacity limit for two resources, each item occupies a specified amount of each resource when assigned to a bin.  The two independant sums of resources occupied by the items assigned to a bin must not exceed either of the bin resource limits.
